Website for [Relay Wizard](https://relaywizard.com/ "Relay Wizard") which is a CLI tool that helps you bootstrap a [Nostr](https://nostr.com/ "Nostr") relay.

The website hosts the Relay Wizard installation script which you can run on a Debian server after hooking up a domain name by running the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://relaywizard.com/install.sh | bash
```

## Learn more

If you want to learn more about how to setup a relay from scratch, check out [Relay Runner](https://relayrunner.org "Relay Runner").

If you just want to know enough to get started, read the following sections to get a server, hook up a domain name and setup remote access:

- [Get a server](https://relayrunner.org/server/get-a-server "Get a server")

- [Get a domain](https://relayrunner.org/server/domain-name "Get a domain")

- [Remote access](https://relayrunner.org/server/remote-access "Remote access")

from here you should be able to run the installation command above and get started.
